# Contentstack Live Preview Utils SDK

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. Build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest.

Contentstack provides the Live Preview Utils SDK to establish a communication channel between the various Contentstack SDKs and your website, transmitting live changes to the preview pane. [Read More](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/live-preview/).

# Installation

To install the package via npm, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @contentstack/live-preview-utils
```

Alternatively, if you want to include the package directly in your website HTML code, use the following command:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@contentstack/live-preview-utils@1.0.1/dist/index.js"></script>
```

# Initializing the SDK

### Live Preview Utils

Since the Live Preview Utils SDK is responsible for communication, you need to only initialize it.
Use the following command to initialize the SDK:

```javascript
import ContentstackLivePreview from "@contentstack/live-preview-utils";

ContentstackLivePreview.init({
    stackDetails: {
        apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
    },
});
```

ternatively, if you want to initialize the SDK directly inside the HTML tag, use the ContentstackLivePreview.init() method as follows:

```html
<script>
    ContentstackLivePreview.init({
        stackDetails: {
            apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
        },
    });
</script>
```

# [Live Editing](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/set-up-live-preview/set-up-live-preview-for-your-website/#live-editing-for-entries-optional-)

Live Preview provides edit tags that allow you to edit your content in real-time. Live edit tags are identified as the data-cslp attribute within the HTML tags. The styles for the live edit tags are available in the @contentstack/live-preview-utils/dist/main.css file.

To use live edit tags within your stack, you need to include them in your main index.js file as follows:

```javascript
import "@contentstack/live-preview-utils/dist/main.css";
```
