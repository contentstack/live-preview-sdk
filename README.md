# Contentstack Live Preview Utils SDK

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. Build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest.

Contentstack provides the Live Preview Utils SDK to establish a communication channel between the various Contentstack SDKs and your website, transmitting live changes to the preview pane. [Read More](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/live-preview/).

# Installation

To install the package via npm, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @contentstack/live-preview-utils
```

Alternatively, if you want to include the package directly in your website HTML code, use the following command:

```html
<script type='module'  integrity='sha384-9M4o9H23Ax5ZTzsMRLgdlFBYk2hy+ub6XDiZhHWJjfebQ+MZ9iZw+GNep9ac0uFV' crossorigin="anonymous">
     import ContentstackLivePreview from 'https://esm.sh/@contentstack/live-preview-utils@3.0.1';

     ContentstackLivePreview.init({
        stackDetails: {
            apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
        },
    });
</script>
```
> [!NOTE]
> This step involves incorporating the package into your HTML code and initializing it, eliminating the need for re-initialization in the subsequent step.


# Initializing the SDK

### Live Preview Utils

Since the Live Preview Utils SDK is responsible for communication, you need to only initialize it.
Use the following command to initialize the SDK:

```javascript
import ContentstackLivePreview from "@contentstack/live-preview-utils";

ContentstackLivePreview.init({
    stackDetails: {
        apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
    },
});
```
