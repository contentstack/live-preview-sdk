# Installation

To install the package via npm using following command:

```bash
npm install @contenstack/live-preview-sdk
```

Alternatively, if you want to include the package directly in your website HTML code, use the following command:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@contentstack/live-preview-sdk@1.1.0/dist/index.js"></script>
```

# Initializing the SDK

### Live preview

Since the live preview SDK is responsible for communication, you need to only initialize it.
Use the following command to initialize the SDK:

```javascript
import ContentstackLivePreview from "@contenstack/live-preview-sdk";

ContentstackLivePreview.init({
    enable: true,
    stackDetails: {
        apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
    },
});
```

Alternatively, if you want to initialize the SDK directly in the HTML tag, use the class attribute ContentstackLivePreview as follows:

```html
<script>
    ContentstackLivePreview.init({
        enable: true,
        stackDetails: {
            apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
        },
    });
</script>
```

# Live editing

Live Preview allows you to edit your content by providing edit tags. Live edit tags are identified as the data-cslp attribute within the HTML tags. The styles for the live edit tags are available in the `@contentstack/live-preview-sdk/dist/main.css` file.

To use the live edit tags within your stack, you need to Include them in your main index.js file as follows:

```javascript
import "@contentstack/live-preview-sdk/dist/main.css";
```
