# Contentstack Live Preveiew SDK

This SDK is responsible to establish a communication channel between the Contentstack SDK and your website, and transfer live changes to the site.

# Installation

You could install this package via npm using following command

```bash
npm install @contenstack/live-preview-sdk
```

or you can include it directly in the HTML.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@contentstack/live-preview-sdk@1.1.0/dist/index.js"></script>
```

# Usage

### Live preview

As this sdk is responsible only for the communication, we only need to initialize the SDK.

```javascript
import ContentstackLivePreview from "@contenstack/live-preview-sdk";

ContentstackLivePreview.init({
    enable: true,
    stackDetails: {
        apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
    },
});
```

If you are adding directly into the HTML tag, then the class is directly available under the same name `ContentstackLivePreview`

```html
<script>
    ContentstackLivePreview.init({
        enable: true,
        stackDetails: {
            apiKey: "your-stack-api-key",
        },
    });
</script>
```

### Live edit tags

Live edit tags are automatically idenfied when present in the `data-cslp` attrubute in the HTML tags. The styles for the live edit tags are available in `@contentstack/live-preview-sdk/dist/main.css`. Include them in your main `index.js` file.

```javascript
import "@contentstack/live-preview-sdk/dist/main.css";
```
